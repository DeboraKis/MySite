         Through dedicated learning and hands-on development work, I've been applying my organizational mindset and communication skills to build user-centric web applications. My healthcare background gives me a unique perspective on creating solutions that are both technically sound and genuinely useful for end users.
I excel in collaborative environments where I can wear multiple hats, from writing clean code to translating technical concepts for stakeholders. Whether it's streamlining backend processes, crafting intuitive user interfaces, or managing project timelines, I approach each challenge with the same attention to detail and user-first mentality that served me well in healthcare.
