            My career path has been anything but conventional. With a background in healthcare and a strong foundation in leadership and customer service, I transitioned into the world of technology, and I haven’t looked back since. As a <b>Junior Software Developer</b>, I now bring a unique blend of organizational expertise, problem-solving skills, and a passion for building intuitive, user-centric web applications.

            After completing an intensive <b>Full-Stack Development Bootcamp</b> at The Jump Tech School in 2024, I gained hands-on experience with technologies like <b>JavaScript, React, Node.js, Python, HTML, and CSS</b>. My transition into tech was motivated by my desire to leverage my experience managing teams, communicating with clients, and handling complex projects—skills that I now apply to every project I work on.
