            Hi there! My name is Debora, and I bring a rich cultural tapestry to everything I do, having been born and raised in Romania with Hungarian roots. I’m fluent in both Hungarian and Romanian, which reflects my diverse background. Eight years ago, I took a leap and moved to the UK, a decision that has been the foundation for immense personal and professional growth. My journey began in the dental field, where I became a qualified dental nurse and pursued further studies to excel in the profession. Over time, however, my curiosity led me toward the world of tech. Inspired by interactions with individuals in the industry, I discovered a passion for web development and software engineering. This newfound interest sparked an exciting career pivot, and I’m now enthusiastically carving out my place in the tech world. Outside of work and learning, I’m drawn to the outdoors, whether it’s running, exploring parks, or simply soaking in the beauty of nature. I also have a passion for food, from experimenting in the kitchen to discovering hidden gems in restaurants and cafes. Traveling is another love of mine, as it allows me to immerse myself in new cultures, gain fresh perspectives, and create unforgettable experiences. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me! I’m excited for the journey ahead in tech and look forward to connecting with others who share a passion for innovation and creativity.
